// We can make components of Things like cards or any other piece of code that are used too often in our
// code just like the card given below. We used it by just typing <CompName/> and also we can dynamically 
// change the content of the component by using props. When we make components like these they have access 
// to props and by using them we can dynamically manupulate its content. Initially props is empty and we can
// add properties in it when we use it. For Example -> <CompName username-"Piyush" age="19" /> here in this example 
// username and age are added in the props.
// Note -> we cannot directly pass an Array or Object in props instead we can declare Array or Object in 
// a variable and the pass it in props like <CompName someObj={varName} />.

// FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT PROPs GO TO -> App.jsx

// function Card(props) { // we can use props like object like in this case but we will need to write 
// props.key1, props.key2,... and so on 
  
function Card({charName="Blank", description, imgURL}) { // Or we can directly use props like this. Here we don't need to 
// write props.key1, we can simply use key1 instead of it props.key1. This method is just convinent
