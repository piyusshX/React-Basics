# React Router DOM (RRD)

We know that react is used to create single page applications and to make it multipage application we
make use of React-Router-DOM Librery. 

# Benifits of RRD

By using RRD, when we switch from one to another or click on a link our whole page doesn't reload only
the specific portion of the page that need to updated is injected in the DOM which saves us from fetching
all the resources from the server.
